# Meridian 59 Tools
A collection of useful tools for Meridian 59. Currently, two asset converter tools are included. The intended use is to convert meridian 59 resource files into modern formats to be used in any modern game engine or editor.
## Tools
### bgf2png
Converts a .bgf file into a png and a json file for meta data. For more information, head to bgf2png/README.md.
### roo2obj
Converts a .roo file into a 3d mesh, outputing a .obj and .mtl file. For more information, head to roo2obj/README.md.
## The Meridian 59 Resource Folder
The Meridian 59 resource folder holds all its game assets (bgf and roo files), and is installed with the game client. You can find this folder in several ways:
- When installing the game through steam, navigate to 
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Meridian 59\resource```. 
- [This shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15S8DFOqC6e0hLIgKeaLneboNBXi0QKdM) contains various Meridian 59 clients, each with its own resource folder available for download.
## TODO
- add gifs / images to bgf2png and roo2obj tool descriptions.
- provide release builds so people don't have to compile from source
